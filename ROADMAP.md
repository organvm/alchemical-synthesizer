# 🗺️ Alchemical Roadmap

This roadmap is a living system. It bridges the gap between the **Brahma Strategy** and daily execution.

## 🚀 Strategic Themes

- **[T] Tech Maturity**: Stability, NRT Rendering, and DSP Optimization.
- **[O] Ontological Growth**: Expanding Adam Kadmon's schema.
- **[E] Ecological Diversity**: Creating new anthropomorphized organisms.

## 📅 Milestones

### Phase 1: Stability (Active)
- [x] Server-side 1kHz Bus Tick
- [x] Basic Sampler Creatures
- [ ] Multi-channel specimen recording

### The Forge — sample → track → visual → post/sell pipeline
> The repeatable spine so a track ships a couple times a week and each one pushes
> the sampler. Stage the joints; ship the smallest reversible piece first.

- [x] **Ingest** — any song → scsynth-ready WAV (`tools/ingest.sh`, ffmpeg). *Verified.*
- [x] **Rip apart** — song → stems (drums/bass/vocals/other) via a tiered cascade
      (`tools/rip.py`): Tier-1 **demucs** (true separation) → Tier-3 **ffmpeg**
      fallback (approximate, dependency-free, runs today). *Verified (ffmpeg tier).*
- [x] **Forge** — recombine stolen stems ("drums from A, melody from B") into a
      recipe + provenance (`tools/forge.sh`), with `--mix` premix. *Verified.*
- [x] **Render** — headless NRT bounce, a WAV → Brahma-re-expressed WAV, no GUI /
      no audio device (`brahma/sc/13_nrt_renderer.scd` + `tools/bounce.sh`).
      *Verified on SuperCollider 3.14.1.*
- [x] **Cadence** — one command from two stems to a track: `make track`. *Verified.*
- [x] **Tier-1 separation live** — demucs (htdemucs) provisioned on Python 3.11
      via `tools/setup-demucs.sh` (uv → `.venv-demucs`, incl. `torchcodec` for the
      torchaudio ≥2.9 I/O backend); `rip.py` auto-discovers the venv (repo-local
      or `$BRAHMA_DEMUCS_PYTHON`) and switches to true drum/melody theft with no
      flags. *Verified on-machine: a tonal input routed to `other` @ −13.5 dB,
      drums/bass/vocals @ ≤ −71 dB — true source split, not a band-split.*
- [x] **Per-stem render** — feed each stem to a distinct creature (drums→Ossuary,
      bass→Mnemosyne, vocals→Chrysalid, melody→Prima) via a multi-buffer Score
      that sums the voices under a master limiter, instead of a single premix
      (`tools/stemforge.py` + `brahma/sc/14_stem_voices.scd`; `make stemtrack`,
      per-stem `--map`). *The "supremely powerful modular" render. Verified on-machine.*
- [x] **Matching visual** — audio-reactive video export from the Etz Chaim Visual
      Cortex (`brahma/web`). A track's audio is analyzed into a per-frame envelope
      (`tools/analyze_audio.py`: RMS + log-spaced spectral bands + flatness + onsets,
      stdlib + ffmpeg), which drives the real p5 sketch headlessly frame-by-frame
      (`tools/render_video.mjs` via puppeteer; `tree/video.js` maps bands→vessels
      bass-to-crown, loudness→gain, flatness→entropy, onsets→Lightning Flash, with a
      deterministic frame-clock override of `millis()`), then ffmpeg muxes frames +
      audio into a post-ready mp4. `make videotrack TRACK=out/x.wav` (setup once via
      `make video`). *Composes with `make track`/`make stemtrack`.*
- [x] **Package** — one command turns a track into a social-ready bundle in
      `out/pkg/<base>/`: the audio-reactive `.mp4` with a "made with Brahma" mark
      (+ track title) drawn *in p5* so it's deterministic (no ffmpeg font burn),
      a `.cover.png` (the track's peak-energy frame, so the still can't drift from
      the clip), and a paste-ready `.caption.txt` (title + attribution + link +
      tags; set `$BRAHMA_LINK` to bake in the funnel URL). `make package
      TRACK=out/x.wav [TITLE="…"] [LINK=…]` (`tools/package.sh` →
      `videotrack.sh --attribution --title --cover`). *Composes with `make
      track`/`make stemtrack`; verified on-machine.*
### AETHER — a living radio: Brahma listens, transmutes, broadcasts
> The evolution of "Funnel" (2026-07-02): the alchemical synthesizer becomes a
> transceiver. It **listens** to free/live web audio, **transmutes** it through
> the Forge, and **broadcasts** its own generative, evolving stream — whose home
> page *is* the funnel (live player + demand capture + the packaged-track archive).

> **Full plan (all paths, to the omega):** [`docs/AETHER-BROADCAST-PLAN.md`](docs/AETHER-BROADCAST-PLAN.md)
> — grounded in the genesis design corpus (`docs/logos/*`, `docs/design/*`) and an excavation of
> deployed streaming machinery across the ecosystem (converge, don't rebuild).

- [x] **Listen** — sample live/free web audio (internet-radio streams +
      public-domain / CC0 archives) into a Forge-ready WAV. `tools/tune.py` +
      `stations.json` (a license-tagged source registry) + `make tune`/`make
      stations`. Every capture writes a provenance sidecar (`<out>.source.json`)
      and is license-gated: `--publish-safe-only` refuses anything not
      public-domain/CC0/CC-BY/own, so an automated cadence can only pull
      clearable material. *Verified on-machine: a 3 s capture from a live icecast
      stream → SPECIMEN VIABLE through `validate_audio.py`, flows into `make
      rip`/`make track`. Rights posture stays human-gated — the tool records the
      license, it does not grant clearance.*
- [ ] **Broadcast (local)** — *[increment 1]* a continuous *generative* Brahma
      performance: the Host-Body chassis runs the Cell-Cycle/METABOLISM organism
      (param drift + folded-in `tune` captures) → **segmented-NRT** A/V (reusing
      `bounce.sh` / `stemforge.py` / `render_video.mjs`) → **live-HLS** (flip
      etceter4's `transcode-video.js` from `vod` to `event`/rolling) → grafted
      **theatron** HLS player, proven end-to-end **locally**. Coherence/Entropy
      labeled provisional. Going public is the deploy gate.
- [ ] **Home = live player + funnel** — *[increment 2]* the landing page becomes
      Brahma's radio station: live player on top, packaged-track archive below,
      real audio at `product/src/api/rest.js:65` (wire the `501` stub), existing
      waitlist (`POST /api/v1/waitlist`). Deploy the static surface (CF Pages /
      Vercel). Capture demand first; no payment rail until a real buyer exists.
- [ ] **24/7 sovereign host** — *[increment 3]* move the generator into a CF
      Container (media-ark's `Dockerfile` + `wrangler containers` pattern, R2 for
      segments). Gated on the $5/mo Workers-Paid lever `L-MEDIA-ARK-HOST`.
- [ ] **Playable / realtime** — *[increment 4]* the "mess around with it live"
      path: realtime scsynth capture + the audio-orb 3D reactive surface + the
      tracker-brained/Ableton-bodied sampler instrument (graft
      `docs/absorb-alchemize/synth-drum-machine.tsx`).
- [ ] **Reach** — *[increment 5]* RTMP re-broadcast lure to YouTube/Twitch
      (converge the livestream-framework CDN sink). The sovereign HLS stream stays
      the home.
- [ ] **Ω — Ouroboros** — *[increment 6]* viewers submit a stream URL → a creature
      eats it live; a lineage browser; the "consume you back" loop; then
      substrate-agnostic (absorb non-audio). *"Output re-enters as input."*

**Human-gated decision atoms** (do not silently decide):
- **Rights posture** — commercially sampling copyrighted songs *or radio/stream
  captures*. Safe default in the tooling: the pipeline runs on *any* input, but
  anything **published/sold** uses rights-cleared source (your own / CC0 /
  licensed) or unrecognizably transformed material; recognizable rips stay
  private R&D until cleared. *Now partly operationalized:* `stations.json` tags
  each source's license and `tune.py --publish-safe-only` enforces the
  public-domain/CC0/CC-BY/own set — but the **policy** (what you actually publish)
  remains yours.
- **Social surface** — which handle/platform hosts the tracks (the studio face is
  text/voice-branded; Brahma music likely needs its own identity).

### Phase 2: Propagation
- [ ] Distributed OSC backplane
- [ ] VCV Rack integration layer
- [ ] Expanded Trait Mapping (FluidBuf integration)
